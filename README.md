I choose the General Public License v3.0
The reason I did this is because I have seen the Gnu with Linux Operating Systems and the idea from Richard Stallman to be in a world with transparent  and open software. Until today the software contains code from thousands of programmers including ideas and culture within. Also, I share his idea that the derivative software from the free open source software should be keep it like that and avoid people less generous who would want to release derivative work in object code under proprietary licenses. Such is the case with code in the public domain that have zero restriction in how the code should be use. The GPL license helps to create a community among individuals and stimulates the open source software by enforcing derivative work to be share under the same GPL license terms.
